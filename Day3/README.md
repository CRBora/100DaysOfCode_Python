Day 3 Control Flow and logical operators

# All code is run and tested on Replit

1. Odd or Even? Introducing the modulo - Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
2. BMI 2.0 - Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.

3. Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza! Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.

Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

Small pizza (S): $15

Medium pizza (M): $20

Large pizza (L): $25

Add pepperoni for small pizza (Y or N): +$2

Add pepperoni for medium or large pizza (Y or N): +$3

Add extra cheese for any size pizza (Y or N): +$1

4. You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

To work out the love score between two people:

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

"Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

"Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
Otherwise, the message will just be their score.
