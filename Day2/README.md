Day 2 - Understanding data types and how to manipulate strings

1. Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

The last line of your program should print the result.

2. Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height. The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m).NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests
