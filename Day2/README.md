Day 2 - Understanding data types and how to manipulate strings

1. Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

The last line of your program should print the result.

2. Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height. The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m).NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests

3. Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x weeks left.
Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

Day 2 Project - Tip Calculator

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this
