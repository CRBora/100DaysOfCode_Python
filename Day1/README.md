Day 1 Coding Exercises

1. Write a program in main.py that prints the following notes on Python programming into the Output console. Your code should print all three lines.
	Day 1 - Python Print Function
	The function is declared like this:
	print('what to print')

2. Look at the code below. There are errors on all 4 lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
	print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
	print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
	  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
	print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

3. Write a program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name.

This program takes two inputs. The first input is stored in a variable called a. The second input is stored in a variable called b.

Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

Warning . You don't need to print anything. The print statement is already in the template code. However, your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

Example Input 1
29
41
Example Output 1
a: 41
b: 29
Example Input 2
Hello
World
Example Output 2
a: World
b: Hello
